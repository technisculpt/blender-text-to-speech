In this video i'm going to describe how the text to speech addon works

Firstly, we need to install the addon

If you're using Windows, you will need to right click blender and click run as administrator, just this one time

We can install the addon by opening the preferences in Blender, and installing the Text to Speech zip file

It might take a moment to install the google text to speech library

When you navigate to the video editing interface you should see the Text to Speech tab

If it doesn't appear, you can toggle the system console to see any errors in Windows

In linux you can open blender from a terminal to see the output

Let me know if you have any issues

You can make individual audio strips by typing something in the text field and pressing speechify

Alternatively you can import a closed caption file and it will convert all the strips to audio

Accent can be chosen before speechify or file import

Currently only text files, s.r.t and s.b.v files are supported

If time codes are provided, audio strips will be placed at that time

In the case of txt files, audio strips will be placed one after another

After importing, you can move the audio strips around, delete them, and mix with individual audio strips

You can then export closed caption files and it will export an updated file that corresponds to your current audio strips

You can save blender, reopen and it will remember the text associated with the audio strips for further editing

Thanks for watching

Let me know if you have any issues!
