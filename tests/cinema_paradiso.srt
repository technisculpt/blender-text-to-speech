6
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,380
Yes, Salvatore. Salvatore DE Vita.

7
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,170
What do you mean you don't know him?

8
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,870
Yes, that's it. I'm his mother.

9
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,540
I'm calling from Sicily,
the whole blessed day.

10
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,040
I see, not there.

11
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,940
Then please, can you tell me...

12
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,060
656-220-56.

13
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,090
Thank you. Good-bye.

14
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,300
Mama, it's useless to call.

15
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,260
He's a busy man, could be anywhere.

16
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,470
He won't remember anymore.

17
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,840
Come on, let it go.

18
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,850
He hasn't been here in 30 years.

19
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,680
You know how he is.

20
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,020
He'll remember.

21
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm sure he'll remember. I
know him better than you.

22
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,160
If he finds out later we didn't
tell him, he'll be angry.

23
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,160
I'd like to talk to Mr. Salvatore DE Vita.

24
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm his mother.

25
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,740
Salvatore...

26
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,940
what time is it?

27
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,410
Very late.

28
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm sorry. There was no
way to let you know.

29
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,560
Go back to sleep.

30
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,590
Your mother called.

31
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,870
She took me for someone else.

32
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,930
What'd you tell her?

33
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,160
I played along.I didn't
want to disappoint her.

34
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,270
We had a long talk.

35
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,840
She said you haven't
visited her in 30 years.

36
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,040
When she wants to see
you, she comes to Rome.

37
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,810
She called just to say that?

38
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,980
No.

39
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,290
She said someone's
died... someone named Alfredo.

40
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,560
The funeral is tomorrow.

41
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,530
Who is he, a relative?

42
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,670
No. Go to sleep.

43
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,510
The boy will be my
death. How can I say Mass?

44
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,020
Lord God, we ask you to be pleased with the sacrifice
we offer you with humble and contrite heart.

45
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,490
Cleanse...

46
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,960
Cleanse...

47
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,130
Toto!

48
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,270
Cleanse me from my sin.

49
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,710
Better late than never.

50
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,310
How often must I say it? Without
the bell, I lose my place.

51
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,650
Always sleeping. What do
you do at night, eat?

52
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,090
Father, at my house we
don't even eat at noon.

53
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,670
The veterinarian says so.
That's why I'm tired.

54
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,570
I know why you're
tired. Don't think I don't.

55
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,070
Now run along home. I've something to do.

56
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,140
- Can I come?
- No, you cannot.

57
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,040
- Yes, yes!
- Toto, out!

58
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,270
I want to! I want to!

59
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,860
Alfredo.

60
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,060
Alfredo!

61
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,160
Yes!

62
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,470
You can start.

63
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,150
Here we go again.

64
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,660
The frame!

65
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,760
Pepe, one day we'll have it all.

66
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,360
We'll go away together...

67
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,500
live the easy life...

68
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,110
where no one knows us.

69
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,370
Forget it.

70
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,270
You don't love me anymore.

71
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,630
Never!

72
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,590
One pair, two pairs!

73
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,590
100 lire! Real nylon!

74
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,620
You mustn't come here.

75
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,810
I told you and told you... like
talking to a wall.

76
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,220
If the film catches fire...

77
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,350
little as you are, you'll go up... boom!

78
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,500
"And turn into a chunk of charcoal."

79
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,100
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

80
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
One day, I'll cut it off.

81
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,770
Like that.

82
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,490
Can I have it?

83
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,960
Come on, can I have it?

84
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,590
- Well, can I?
- No!

85
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,070
Deaf as a post!

86
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,140
I have to splice it back
before I return the film.

87
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,770
What a pest you are!

88
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,670
Why didn't you splice these
when you gave the films back?

89
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,110
Sometimes I can't find the right
place, so they stay here.

90
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,620
Anyway, they kiss too much.

91
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,260
Then I can have them.

92
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,690
No. Now look, come here.

93
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,930
Before I kick your fanny,
I'll make you a deal.

94
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,930
All those are yours... a present.

95
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,400
Thanks.

96
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,840
But one, you keep out of here, and
two, they stay with me. Got it?

97
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,240
All right.

98
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,970
Right. Then we agree. Now scram.

99
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,190
What kind of a deal is that?

100
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,020
If they're mine, how come you keep them?

101
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,700
Don't come back, or I'll thrash you!

102
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,510
"Shoot first, think later."

103
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,850
"This is no job for
weaklings, traitorous dog."

104
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,760
"Hey, you! Dirty swine,
hands off that gold!"

105
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,000
"Black hearted pig, stay away from me...

106
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
or I'll smash your face in."

107
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,130
Mama, the war's over, but...
why doesn't Papa come back?

108
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,730
He'll come back, you'll
see. One of these days.

109
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,730
I don't remember him.

110
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,300
Where's Russia?

111
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,010
It takes years to get there
and years to come back.

112
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,310
Go to bed. It's late.

113
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,520
You can hoodwink your mother, but not me!

114
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,620
Get your diploma and join the police!
Lazybones!

115
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,390
Good-for-nothing! Get in there and study!

116
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,230
Well? How much is 5 times 5?

117
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,570
30.

118
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,480
Silence!

119
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,780
Table of 5's, dimwit.

120
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,280
1 times 5 is 5...

121
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,150
2 times 5 is 10...

122
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,760
3 times 5 is 15...

123
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,920
4 times 5 is 20...

124
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,530
5 times 5?

125
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,170
40.

126
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,170
Silence!

127
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,110
Boccia...

128
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,310
25.

129
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,020
Learn your tables, or
you'll never get a job.

130
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,090
For the last time...

131
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,120
what is 5 times 5?

132
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Christmas!

133
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,720
I paid to get in. I'm seeing the movie.

134
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,430
Get down from there, you devil.

135
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,440
Go back to your seat.

136
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,740
Worse than rabbits. They're
all over the place.

137
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,780
Little monsters.

138
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,620
I'm off to Oregon.

139
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,750
Wait for me at my ranch.

140
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,020
Wait for a dead man?

141
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,760
A star-studded cast...

142
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,490
featuring John Wayne...

143
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,760
Claire Trevor...

144
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,740
Hello, everyone!

145
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,580
- Can't I say hello?
- Double feature today.

146
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,650
So? I'm here to sleep.

147
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,680
- What's your smoke?
- Americans.

148
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,160
Cut the news, Alfredo!

149
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,810
The men and women who fought in secret...

150
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,970
brave guerrillas, reunited in Rome...

151
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,240
for the first Resistance Rally.

152
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,220
What does it say?

153
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,450
I'm illiterate.

154
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,720
You, too?

155
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,740
Twelve hours of blood and sweat...

156
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,080
to bring home barely enough
to keep from starving.

157
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,580
Yet their nets...

158
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,020
when they pulled them up, were full.

159
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
I knew it!

160
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,660
Twenty years I've gone to
movies and never saw a kiss.

161
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,930
And when will we?

162
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,870
Kiss my ass!

163
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,960
- Don Vincenzo.
- You and you, to work.

164
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,030
What about me?

165
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,760
Go get a job from Stalin.

166
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,340
His day will come, even here. You watch.

167
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,200
I always get left out.

168
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,710
Good movie. The kid really acted well.

169
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,540
Too bad he was so unlucky.

170
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,740
What a jackass to buy that boat.

171
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,450
Idiot, you didn't get it at all.

172
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,590
Right, boys, you work from dawn to dusk.

173
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,700
And don't ask how much it pays.

174
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
Mama.

175
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,150
I waited all day. You got milk?

176
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
No.

177
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,060
The money?

178
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,500
Stolen.

179
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,470
You spent it on movies?

180
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,340
Movies, always movies!

181
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,310
Signora Maria, wait.

182
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,940
Leave him alone. Go easy.

183
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,360
And you, why do you tell lies?

184
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,360
You know you got in free.

185
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,360
Tell your mother.

186
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,790
Maybe he lost the money inside.

187
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,330
- How much?
- 50 lire.

188
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,470
What'd you find tonight, under the seats?

189
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,770
A comb.

190
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,310
Two shoe lifts.

191
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,150
- Can of tobacco...
- And?

192
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,120
50 lire.

193
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,190
See?

194
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,630
Thank you, Alfredo.

195
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,970
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

196
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,500
See you.

197
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,890
I understood right away.

198
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,890
The square is mine! It's my square!

199
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,150
It's midnight. Midnight!

200
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,200
Out! Shoo! I have to close the square.

201
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,950
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

202
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,460
Going, it's all downhill and
all the saints help out.

203
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,990
But coming back, the saints just watch.

204
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,200
If that's God's will.

205
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,370
See you tonight.

206
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,480
What's wrong?

207
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,100
Your foot this time.

208
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,710
Always something. What can we do?

209
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,780
Alfredo, did you know my father?

210
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,620
What a question. And how I knew him.

211
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,460
Tall, thin, jolly, with a
nice mustache like me.

212
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,190
Always smiling. A lot like Clark Gable.

213
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,200
Now that I'm older and go to fifth grade...

214
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,400
I don't say I should come in the booth...

215
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,740
but can't we at least be friends?

216
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,780
"I choose my friends for looks,
my enemies for intelligence."

217
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,120
You're too foxy to be my friend.

218
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,990
I always tell my children...

219
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,290
"Be careful how you choose your friends."

220
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,020
You haven't got any children.

221
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,400
When I do, I'll tell them.

222
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,540
Don't cry, don't cry. It's all right.

223
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,440
The fire's out. It's over. I'm here.

224
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,320
What happened?

225
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,420
Monster!

226
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,320
Your little sister
could've burned to death.

227
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,790
And all your fault!

228
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,030
I told you not to keep your film
under the bed by the fire pan.

229
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,200
Even the photographs burned!

230
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,970
Nearly set fire to the house.

231
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,050
You and your stupid movies!

232
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,290
Aren't you ashamed at your
age to play with a boy?

233
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,860
Why look at me? What did I do?

234
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,820
Who gave him the film?

235
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,990
Don't do it again. He goes crazy. Crazy!

236
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,830
All I hear is movies, Alfredo.

237
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,300
Alfredo, movies!

238
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,410
Swear you won't let him in again. Swear it!

239
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,770
You have my word.

240
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,580
God grant me this.

241
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,150
Send your father home to whip you!

242
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,150
Papa won't come back, and I know why.

243
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,660
He's dead.

244
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,260
That's not true.

245
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,960
You'll see, he'll come back.

246
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,360
They smoke like chimneys.

247
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,770
No. Go buy a ticket.

248
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
No!

249
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,760
What was that?

250
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,430
I'll make mincemeat of you!
You'll reckon with me!

251
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,010
Signora Anna!

252
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,470
Alfredo.

253
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,770
Don't blame me. Your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

254
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,280
I told my mother you
didn't give me the film.

255
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,640
It wasn't your fault.

256
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,650
I thought it was a joke
about film catching fire.

257
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,780
I just wanted to tell you. Now I'll go.

258
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,360
Toto, come here.

259
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,920
Come on, come sit down.

260
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,900
Now listen. I got into
this business at age ten.

261
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,770
Back then, we didn't have fancy machines.

262
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,710
Movies were silent.

263
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,340
You turned the projector by hand...

264
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,970
with a crank.

265
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,110
The whole livelong day!

266
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,990
And it was hard, that damn crank.

267
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,990
If you got tired and slowed down a bit...

268
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,960
like a shot, whom, everything burned.

269
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,440
So why not teach me?

270
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,600
Now that there's no crank
and it's dead easy.

271
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,600
Because I don't want to.

272
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,410
It's no kind of job for you.

273
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,780
You're like a slave...

274
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,850
and always alone.

275
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,390
You see a film 100 times. You've
nothing else to do.

276
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,520
You talk to Garbo and Tyrone Power like a
loony bird.

277
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,630
You work like a burro.

278
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,700
Even holidays... Easter, Christmas.

279
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,360
You only get Good Friday off.

280
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,990
And if they hadn't stuck
Christ on a cross...

281
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,570
we'd even work then.

282
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,400
So why don't you change jobs?

283
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,380
Because I'm a nitwit.

284
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,250
Who else around here could run a projector?

285
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,020
Nobody. It takes an imbecile like me.

286
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,800
And I never had any luck.

287
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:07,270
So! Want to be a stick-in-the-mud like me?
How about it?

288
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,540
Atta boy, Toto.

289
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,910
I only tell you for your own good.

290
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,450
Cooped up here. Suffocate in
summer, freeze to death in winter.

291
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,680
Breathing fumes.

292
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,850
And you earn chicken feed.

293
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,820
Don't you like anything about it?

294
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,830
Oh, it grows on you.

295
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,790
Sometimes you listen...

296
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,190
and the house is full of people...

297
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,500
giggling and laughing.

298
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,940
Then you're happy too.

299
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,800
It makes you feel good to hear them.

300
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,500
Like you're the one who made them laugh...

301
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,950
who made them forget their troubles.

302
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,810
That part I like.

303
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,330
I might as well speak Greek!
What're you up to?

304
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,060
Pretend to listen, then play the clown!

305
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,470
Your mother's right! You're a scatterbrain!

306
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,950
How'd the rascal do it?
He learned by watching.

307
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,750
I'm telling the manager not to let you in!

308
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,620
And I'll see Father Adelfio!
No more altar boy! Finished!

309
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,650
Alfredo!

310
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,160
Up yours!

311
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,510
I got it! I won! I won
the football lottery!

312
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,490
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

313
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,060
Hey, Ciccio from Naples won the lottery!

314
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,190
Always the northerners who hit it lucky.

315
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,160
The square is mine! All mine!

316
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,070
Hold still! Horseflies bothering you?

317
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,640
You got a lice factory up here.

318
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,370
Beat it.

319
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,560
What're you after? A smack?

320
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,500
Get out of here.

321
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,640
A merchant owns two stores.

322
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,770
In one, he sells fruit.

323
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,280
Be seated.

324
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,890
Professor...

325
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,480
the auditors taking the exam
for the grade school diploma.

326
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,330
Silence!

327
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,140
Rotten little stinker.

328
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,410
- Toto, help me.
- Silence!

329
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,290
I can't do this damn thing.

330
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,510
Toto!

331
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,730
O.K.

332
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,170
Francesco Messana...

333
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,280
you're under arrest.

334
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,510
Good riddance!

335
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,050
Kiss my ass! Pencil pusher!

336
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,170
Right here is where it can catch fire.

337
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,240
If it does, cut here and here, or
the whole reel will burn. Got it?

338
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,560
Yes. Alfredo.

339
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,680
Never. We'll never have that here.

340
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,220
Which side is the gelatin on?

341
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,350
It tastes good.

342
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:23,360
Shipping invoice for the film.
Always keep them.

343
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,200
I will, Alfredo.

344
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,170
Don't ever forget.

345
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,790
This is for you. Today you
load the reels yourself.

346
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,170
- It's so high!
- Now you can run it alone.

347
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,570
Hold it.

348
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:04,410
- What a build!
- My turn!

349
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,380
Say good-bye to Peppino.
He's leaving for Germany.

350
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,880
Why don't you say good-bye?

351
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,430
My father says he's a communist.

352
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,460
God keep you, Mama.

353
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,860
Will he really find work in Germany?

354
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,060
You never know. Like playing the lottery...

355
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,070
you live on hope.

356
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,470
Screw this country!

357
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,010
Go work in Germany, you and your Stalin.

358
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,980
Good-bye, Mama.

359
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,810
Good-bye, Peppino! Come back soon!

360
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,010
We'll see you.

361
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,420
Good-bye!

362
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,460
Lucky thing Germany is closer than Russia.

363
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:07,160
After six years, the
return of spring fashion.

364
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,900
Fresh and breezy...

365
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,700
unlike the pompous styles of wartime.

366
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,720
I'll make mincemeat of you!

367
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,760
"You'll reckon with me!"

368
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,050
Another sad page...

369
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,020
in the tragedy of our men in Russia.

370
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,450
The Defense Ministry...

371
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:01,620
has released a new list of Italian dead...

372
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,590
until now considered missing.

373
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,390
The names will be posted by local military
authorities.

374
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,560
Families concerned will be notified.

375
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,810
However, we don't know where he's buried.

376
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,280
Here's the pension form. Sign it, please.

377
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,520
Out! Go home! We can't have another show!

378
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:54,100
It's late. Be reasonable.
We can't show it again!

379
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,100
Some peoples at through it twice!

380
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,730
We've been waiting for an hour!

381
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,880
Tomorrow we'll have another movie.

382
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:18,420
A western. Word of Honor! Go home to bed.

383
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,090
They'll wreck the Paradiso!
All hell will break loose!

384
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,600
Alfredo, let us in!

385
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,900
What can I do?

386
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,410
I've been waiting for three hours!

387
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,250
"A mob doesn't think.

388
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,580
It has a mind of its own."

389
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,880
Spencer Tracy said that in "Fury."

390
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,990
Well, what do you say?

391
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,790
Shall we let the poor
devils see their film?

392
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,200
Fantastic. But how?

393
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:07,370
"If you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see."

394
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,670
Now get your fanny off that stool.

395
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,080
Get ready.

396
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,410
Abracadabra...

397
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,920
and we pass through walls.

398
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:02,290
Go look out the window.

399
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,860
Alfredo, it's beautiful.

400
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,200
Over there! It's the movie!

401
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,110
Bravo, Alfredo.

402
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,180
Thank you, Alfredo!

403
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,520
What's going on?

404
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,390
It's a movie!

405
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,000
To hell with you.

406
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,100
There's no sound!

407
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,980
Shall we make them happy?

408
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,910
Want to go down?

409
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,580
Go on.

410
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,460
- Look.
- Good Lord.

411
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,210
And Nunzio, half price.

412
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,650
Have to buy tickets, folks.

413
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,290
Reduced rates.

414
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,440
Up yours! The square belongs to everyone!

415
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:25,970
Oh, no!

416
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,440
The square is mine! Don't joke about that!
It makes me mad!

417
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,740
Alfredo!

418
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:20,340
Alfredo! No! Alfredo!

419
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,810
Alfredo, Alfredo. Help! Help!

420
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,520
Alfredo, Alfredo!

421
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,190
Help!

422
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,410
Poor Alfredo. What a shame.

423
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,800
All burned!

424
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,980
It all burned down!

425
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,360
What do we do now?

426
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,230
We have no more entertainment. Nothing.

427
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:25,610
Where'll we get the money to rebuild?

428
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,540
Take a look at Ciccio. So
spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

429
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,140
Who has that kind of money?

430
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,230
The new Cinema Paradiso!

431
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,760
Come in, come in.

432
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,030
This theater is for you!

433
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:36,170
He's just a boy. What about labor laws?

434
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:40,080
I got the license through connections.

435
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,440
Don't ask me how their minds work.

436
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:47,280
Officially, I'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

437
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,510
Stay on your toes, Toto. No sleeping.

438
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,780
We've had enough disasters.

439
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,660
Do what poor Alfredo taught
you. And God bless you.

440
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,620
Thank you, Father.

441
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,030
What is this, a funeral? Life goes on!
Gaiety! Music!

442
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,890
Get a load of that!

443
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,400
Our Father...

444
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:11,380
My God, they're kissing!

445
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:19,070
I won't watch pornography.

446
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,910
Three cheers for Ciccio!

447
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:59,309
Any room for me in this new paradise?

448
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,870
Alfredo!

449
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:08,240
Bring him home after you close.

450
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,980
I'm going, Alfredo.

451
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:12,050
It's great you came.

452
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,190
How're things at school?

453
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,730
Fine, but now that I'm working...

454
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,920
maybe I won't go anymore.

455
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,930
No. No, Toto.

456
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,730
Don't do that.

457
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,310
You'll end up with egg on your face.

458
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,140
Why? What does that mean?

459
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,140
It means...

460
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:42,880
that this isn't your real work.

461
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,750
Right now the Paradiso needs you...

462
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,860
and you need the Paradiso...

463
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,360
but it's a stopgap.

464
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,350
One day you'll go on... to other things.

465
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,520
Things...

466
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,190
that are more important.

467
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,200
Definitely more important.

468
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:10,240
I know. Now that I've lost my sight...

469
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,240
I see better.

470
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,110
Things I never saw before.

471
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,690
All thanks to you, who saved my life.

472
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,750
I won't forget it.

473
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,820
And don't look like that.

474
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,450
I'm not senile yet. Want proof?

475
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:30,970
- Yes.
- Well, let's see.

476
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,970
For example...

477
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,340
right now, the film's out of focus.

478
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,940
Go check.

479
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:45,180
You're right, it's out of focus.

480
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,370
How'd you know?

481
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,340
Too hard to explain.

482
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,470
What's the idea? Watch the screen. Animals,
rapists!

483
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,490
Look, don't touch.

484
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,150
I told you... it doesn't catch fire.

485
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:37,760
Progress always comes too late.

486
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,460
Workers of the world...

487
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,500
She's new.

488
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,270
Not bad.

489
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:04,780
Approachable.

490
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:08,940
Father's the bank manager. Pride,
pomp and circumstance.

491
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,750
Jerks off with his shirt,
not to get his hand dirty.

492
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,220
Go, man, go!

493
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,070
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

494
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,490
You dropped this.

495
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,150
Oh, thanks.

496
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,480
I didn't even notice.

497
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,630
My name's Salvatore. What's yours?

498
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,200
Elena. My name's Elena.

499
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:01,170
I wanted to tell you, well, the
other day at the station...

500
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:15,750
The small projector? Your footage?

501
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:17,520
What do you see?

502
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:21,320
Slaughterhouse workers killing a heifer.

503
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:25,760
Blood all over the floor, like a lake.

504
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:28,520
Over the lake comes another heifer...

505
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,860
about to die.

506
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:40,340
Why'd you stop? What do we see?

507
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:44,740
Nothing. We don't see anything.
It's all fuzzy.

508
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,140
A woman.

509
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,550
It's a woman.

510
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:56,650
Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

511
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,890
What's she like?

512
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,930
She's very nice.

513
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:07,340
My age, slim, long hair, brown.

514
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,530
Big eyes, very blue, honest and direct.

515
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,800
A little beauty mark on her lip.

516
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:17,430
Very small. You only see it up close.

517
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:23,810
When she smiles, you
feel like... I don't know.

518
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,650
Love.

519
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,350
Love.

520
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:38,660
I know how it is... The
blue-eyed ones are the worst.

521
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,790
No matter what you do, they'll
never be your friends.

522
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,300
Nothing for it.

523
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,240
The bigger the man, the deeper his imprint.

524
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:53,840
And if he loves, he suffers, knowing it's a
dead-end street.

525
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,510
That's nice, what you just said.

526
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,050
But sad.

527
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:04,020
I didn't say it. It was John Wayne in
"The Shepherd of the Hills".

528
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,250
You old pirate.

529
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:39,930
- Hello, Elena.
- Hello.

530
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,960
Why're you running?

531
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:44,900
Because...

532
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,190
I wanted to tell you...

533
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:53,370
you remember when we...

534
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,870
Nice day, isn't it?

535
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,280
Yes, really nice.

536
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:10,220
Excuse me, I have to go. Bye.

537
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,820
What a jerk. What a jerk!

538
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:20,830
"Nice day, isn't it?"

539
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,100
Of all the assholes!

540
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,670
I told you so.

541
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:28,070
You thought I was joking.

542
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:33,510
But take it from me, the
blue-eyed ones are the worst.

543
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,210
But why? There must be a way to make her
understand.

544
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:42,120
Don't even try. With feelings,
there's nothing to understand...

545
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,120
and no way to explain.

546
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:45,620
Oh, you made the world!

547
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:48,700
With due respect to the Lord...

548
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:51,030
who made the world in two, three days...

549
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,760
I'd have taken a bit longer...

550
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,870
but in all modesty, I
would've done it better.

551
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:01,030
Like I said... you always have an answer.

552
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,850
Just for you, Toto, I'll tell you a story.

553
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,850
Let's sit down a minute.

554
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,320
Misery of miseries.

555
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,720
Once...

556
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,290
a king gave a feast...

557
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:23,090
for the loveliest princesses in the realm.

558
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:27,430
Now, a soldier who was standing guard...

559
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,090
saw the king's daughter go by.

560
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,710
She was the most beautiful of all...

561
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,140
and he instantly fell in love.

562
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,010
But what is a simple soldier...

563
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:41,780
next to the daughter of a king?

564
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:47,320
Well, at last he succeeded
in meeting her...

565
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,520
and he told her he could no
longer live without her.

566
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:56,560
The princess was so taken by
the depth of his feeling...

567
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,000
that she said to the soldier...

568
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,100
"if you can wait..."

569
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,870
"for 100 days and 100
nights under my balcony..."

570
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:11,380
"at the end of it, I shall be yours."

571
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:17,620
With that, the soldier
went and waited one day...

572
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:20,620
two days, then ten, then twenty.

573
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,020
Each evening the princess looked out...

574
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,320
and he never moved!

575
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:30,120
In rain, in wind, in snow,
he was always there.

576
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:33,600
Birds shat on his head, bees stung him...

577
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,600
but he didn't budge.

578
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,140
At the end...

579
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,340
of 90 days...

580
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,980
he had become...

581
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:51,610
all dry, all white.

582
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,420
Tears streamed from his eyes.

583
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,820
He couldn't hold them back.

584
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,120
He didn't even have the strength to sleep.

585
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,500
And all that time, the
princess watched him.

586
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:12,160
At long last, it was the 99th night...

587
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:17,370
and the soldier stood up, took his chair...

588
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:18,880
and left.

589
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,880
What? At the end?

590
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,220
At the very end.

591
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:28,790
And don't ask what it means. I don't know.

592
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,850
If you understand it, you tell me.

593
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,710
Only one print?

594
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:54,250
You know I need two.
One for the Paradiso...

595
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:57,380
one for the next town.

596
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:02,550
You promised. I put up
posters, made commitments!

597
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,820
If you screw me, watch out!

598
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:08,020
One print for two theaters!

599
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,820
You'll pay for this!

600
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,300
I'm from Naples, and you
will see it and die!

601
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:56,030
We see the crib. The child's asleep.

602
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,500
"Do something!"

603
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,060
The lawyer told me. Now I know.

604
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:27,510
"The lawyer told me. Now I know."

605
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:33,150
And everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know.

606
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,010
"Everyone must know."

607
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:40,080
You believe me?

608
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,750
"You believe me?"

609
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,990
Yes, I believe you.

610
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:47,460
"Yes, I believe you."

611
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,370
Our own home. How I've dreamed of it.

612
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:02,410
- "Our own home."
- "How I've dreamed of it."

613
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,020
Tonino!

614
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,260
Mama.

615
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:20,760
Mama!

616
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,470
The End.

617
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,620
I don't like it. I don't like it.

618
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,030
I cut the end credits to go faster.

619
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:05,660
Hurry back with part one.
I'll show a newsreel.

620
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:08,330
I'll call the police. Take him.

621
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,750
Just a minute. Just a minute!

622
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:33,769
Give me part two. Here's part one.

623
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:36,360
Hurry, the house is packed.

624
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,770
Come on, slowpoke. Get her rolling!

625
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,590
Bunch of animals. Quiet!

626
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,450
Come on, Toto, they'll explode!

627
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,680
It's been a half hour!

628
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,320
What can I do?

629
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,280
Where is that son of a jackass?
I'll be ruined.

630
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:36,430
Calm down, calm down.

631
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:42,800
I'll have you know, just
to see this movie...

632
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,930
I left my wife homesick in bed...

633
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,440
and I haven't seen a thing.

634
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,880
If it's not here in ten minutes,
give us back our money.

635
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,280
Me and everyone here!

636
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,040
Or with this, I'll wreck the place!

637
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:04,080
Calm down! Calm down and let me talk.

638
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:07,230
Tell you what. I'll show
part one another time.

639
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:17,030
Quiet, quiet!

640
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:21,270
I've seen the whole movie.
I'll tell you the plot.

641
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:42,090
Alfredo, what is it?

642
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:44,490
I can't. The Host is on the altar.

643
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:47,860
Father, I need you urgently...

644
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,650
because I have doubts...

645
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,030
terrible doubts tormenting my soul.

646
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,130
Your soul.

647
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,170
Father, I've sinned.

648
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:04,309
- Do that after.
- But who...

649
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,300
Stay there. Don't move.

650
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,920
Just act normal. It's Salvatore.

651
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:10,610
How'd you get here?

652
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,090
Alfredo, that's a terrible thing to say.

653
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:18,230
I know.

654
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:22,190
But take the miracle of
the loaves and fishes.

655
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,660
What about it?

656
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,560
I always wonder... how is it possible?

657
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:31,100
I had to talk to you.

658
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,480
You're beautiful, Elena.

659
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,010
That's what I wanted to tell you.

660
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:50,290
When we meet, I can't say anything right...

661
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:53,490
because you give me the shivers.

662
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:58,290
I don't know what others do in these cases.

663
01:21:58,530 --> 01:21:59,660
It's my first time.

664
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,660
But I'm in love with you.

665
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:06,140
Father, I have sinned.

666
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:08,370
I absolve you, in the name of the Father...

667
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:09,870
Son and Holy Ghost.

668
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,880
Go in peace.

669
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:19,050
When you laugh, you're even prettier.

670
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:31,160
Salvatore, you're very sweet,
and I like you very much...

671
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,860
but I don't love you.

672
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,770
I don't care. I'll wait.

673
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:42,230
What?

674
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,500
For you to fall in love with me.

675
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,580
Now listen.

676
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,080
Every night after work, I'll
come stand outside your house.

677
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:54,120
And I'll wait. Every night.

678
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,190
When you change your
mind, open your window.

679
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,520
That's all. I'll understand.

680
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,060
You understand now?

681
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:07,360
Yes, finally, I see the light.

682
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:14,200
Next time, don't talk heresy.

683
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,980
You survived the theater fire,

684
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:20,479
but from the Eternal
Fire... that is, Eternal Fire...

685
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,180
no one can save you.

686
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:07,750
Fifteen seconds to the new year!

687
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:11,960
14, 13, 12

688
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:16,030
11, 10, 9, 8...

689
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,130
Salvatore.

690
01:28:30,730 --> 01:28:33,220
Oh, great. Never been driven, he said.

691
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:40,660
How'll we get home?

692
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:44,030
Stop!

693
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:48,570
Oh, God, it's my father.

694
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:52,010
Hello, Mr. Mendola.

695
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

696
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:24,140
Play at an open-air theater.

697
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:38,390
Standing room only!

698
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,930
Come on in. The show just started.

699
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:50,940
Have your tickets ready.

700
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,640
Salvatore, my love.

701
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:29,330
A whole summer with my
family, far from you,

702
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,780
my days here go on forever.

703
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:36,280
I see your name everywhere in
a book, a crossword puzzle...

704
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,710
a newspaper.

705
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:39,250
You're always before my eyes.

706
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:42,450
Today, alas, I have bad news.

707
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:46,750
In October we move to Palermo,
where I'll go to university.

708
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,330
So we won't see each other every day.

709
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:53,060
But don't worry, whenever I can get away...

710
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,470
I'll come to you at the Paradiso.

711
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:00,360
I'm blind!

712
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:20,990
By God's might, by man's running! Rise up!

713
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,920
When will this rotten summer end?

714
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,020
In a film, it'd already be over.

715
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,320
Fade-out: cut to storm.
Wouldn't that be great?

716
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:15,950
Tell them I am Odyssey!

717
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:28,950
Elena... But when?

718
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,760
Today.

719
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:34,060
You can't imagine the excuses
I made up to come here.

720
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:04,530
I'm doing my military service in Rome.
I leave Friday.

721
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:06,960
I'll come to say good-bye at the Paradiso.

722
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,630
I'll arrive Thursday, by 5 p.m. bus.

723
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:20,140
Maybe the army made a mistake.
Anyway, Rome is beautiful.

724
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,510
Load the reels for tomorrow,
ready for the new man.

725
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:28,980
Hey, cheer up.

726
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,560
I'll wait for you.
Don't worry.

727
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,560
The job'll still be here.

728
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,560
I'll wait, you hear?

729
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,990
Don't look so gloomy.

730
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:38,720
Come on! Hup!

731
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:22,840
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd
Battalion, 9th Company, sir!

732
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:30,510
Transferred her father? No way!
And no one knows where?

733
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:33,710
Screw you if you won't tell me!
Asshole son of a bitch!

734
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:27,670
You're thinner.

735
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,430
Put you through it, eh?

736
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:32,900
They tell me you never go out...

737
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,700
and you never talk to anybody.

738
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:35,980
Why?

739
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,310
You know how it is.

740
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:43,510
Sooner or later the time comes...

741
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:46,880
whether you talk or don't talk...

742
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:48,890
it's the same thing.

743
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,280
So you might as well shut up.

744
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,070
It's hot here.

745
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:04,960
Take me to the sea.

746
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:08,800
At a party, a lieutenant
pinches this girl's ass.

747
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:12,780
She turns around. It's
the colonel's daughter.

748
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,610
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

749
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:19,880
"if your heart is as hard as what
I just felt, I'm a dead man."

750
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,820
You haven't seen her?

751
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:30,530
No.

752
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,800
And no one knows where she is.

753
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:39,670
Probably that's how it was meant to be.

754
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:44,140
We, each of us, have a star to follow.

755
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,210
Get out of here.

756
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:49,210
This land is cursed.

757
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:53,290
Living here day by day...

758
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,880
you think it's the center of the world.

759
01:37:57,090 --> 01:38:00,860
You believe nothing will ever change.

760
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:04,660
Then you leave... a year, two years.

761
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,320
When you come back, everything's changed.

762
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:10,200
The thread's broken.

763
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:13,000
What you came to find isn't there.

764
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,040
What was yours is gone.

765
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:18,970
You have to go away for a long time...

766
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:21,310
many years...

767
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:26,440
before you can come back
and find your people.

768
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:30,020
The land where you were born.

769
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:32,250
But now, no. It's not possible.

770
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:35,120
Right now you're blinder than I am.

771
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:39,130
Who said that? Gary Cooper? James Stewart?
Henry Fonda?

772
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:41,100
No, Toto.

773
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,840
Nobody said it.

774
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,540
This time it's all me.

775
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,610
Life isn't like in the movies.

776
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:56,980
Life...

777
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:59,020
is much harder.

778
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,780
Get out of here.

779
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,050
Go back to Rome. You're young...

780
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,590
the world is yours.

781
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:11,560
And I'm old.

782
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:15,630
I don't want to hear you talk anymore.

783
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:18,140
I want to hear talk about you.

784
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,580
Don't come back.

785
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:41,850
Don't think about us.

786
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:44,790
Don't look back. Don't write.

787
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:50,420
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget us all.

788
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,860
If you do and you come
back, don't come see me.

789
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,630
I won't let you in my house.
Understand?

790
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,540
Thank you.

791
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:10,050
For everything you've done for me.

792
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,710
Whatever you end up doing, love it.

793
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:19,880
The way you loved the projection booth...

794
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,930
when you were a little squirt.

795
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:36,700
He's left. Toto! Good-bye!

796
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,780
Got here too late, what a shame.

797
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:48,280
It's Toto. I knew it.

798
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:25,220
See how nice the house is?

799
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:30,420
We had it all redone, all thanks to you.

800
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:34,320
I have a surprise for you. Come.

801
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:37,020
Are you tired?

802
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:40,100
You have time to rest before the funeral.

803
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:43,760
No, Mama, it's only an hour by plane.

804
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:47,700
Don't tell me that after all these years.

805
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:51,940
Come. I put everything in here.
All your things.

806
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:42,350
He must be glad you came, Toto.

807
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:47,390
He always talked about you. Always.

808
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:51,400
Right up to the end.

809
01:45:54,370 --> 01:45:58,860
He really... He really loved you.

810
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:15,250
He left something for you.

811
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,680
Before you leave...

812
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:20,720
come see me.

813
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:56,050
How have you been?

814
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:08,960
When did you close it down?

815
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:13,560
Six years ago in May.
Nobody came anymore.

816
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:18,670
You know better than I, Mr. Di
Vita... the economy, TV, videos.

817
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:22,480
The old movie business is just a memory.

818
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,050
The city bought the site for a parking lot.

819
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:31,920
They're demolishing it Saturday.
It's too bad.

820
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:36,090
What's this "Mr. Di Vita"?

821
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:39,220
You used to order me around.

822
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:44,200
Now that you're a big shot, it's a little
different.

823
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:47,670
But, if you insist, Toto.

824
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:52,340
Excuse me.

825
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,580
Who would've believed it... little Toto.

826
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:19,190
This is... what he left for you.

827
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:23,370
He never asked to see me?

828
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:26,010
No, never.

829
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:31,240
Once your mother said to him...

830
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,550
that if he wanted it, you'd surely come.

831
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,790
He was furious. He said, "No."

832
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:43,330
"Toto must never come back to Giancaldo!"

833
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:48,660
He didn't say it to be mean.

834
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,830
He was a good man.

835
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:56,040
Who knows what was going through his head.

836
01:49:56,210 --> 01:50:00,340
Towards the end, he said strange things.

837
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:07,180
A moment before he closed his eyes...

838
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:11,620
he told your mothers he
mustn't let you know.

839
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,610
What're you thinking?

840
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:32,180
Just that I've always
been afraid to come back.

841
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:39,760
And now, after all these years,
I thought I was stronger...

842
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:42,260
that I'd forgotten a lot of things.

843
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:45,790
But in fact...

844
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:48,370
I find I'm right back where I was...

845
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:51,200
as if I'd never been away.

846
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:56,140
Yet when I look around, I
don't recognize anyone.

847
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:02,040
And you, Mama...

848
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:05,280
I deserted you.

849
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,510
Ran out on you like a bandit...

850
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,690
without any explanation.

851
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:12,480
I never asked for any.

852
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:15,130
You don't have to explain to me.

853
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:20,130
I always thought it was good what you did.
Why harp on it?

854
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:23,190
You were right to leave.

855
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:26,170
You did what you wanted to do.

856
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:32,580
When I call you, a different
woman always answers.

857
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:38,010
But I never heard in any of their voices...

858
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:40,210
that they really loved you.

859
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:42,719
I would've known.

860
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,850
All the same, I'd have liked...

861
01:55:44,990 --> 01:55:49,360
to see you settled...

862
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,360
loving someone.

863
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:54,660
But your life is there.

864
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:57,700
Here there are only ghosts.

865
01:55:57,970 --> 01:55:59,300
Let go, Toto.

866
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,720
It's my square. It's mine.

867
01:58:00,990 --> 01:58:04,260
Check the leader. Roll when you're ready.

868
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,090
Right. And I liked your film. Terrific.

869
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:08,370
Thanks.
